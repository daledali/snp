# SOAPnote-website-code
This is all the code for the website [SOAPnote.org](http://www.soapnote.org)
The site makes client-side forms and calculators and produces text output for pasting in electronic health records.  Each form and calculator is written with [SOAPnote Markup or Lingo](http://www.soapnote.org/lingo).
The SOAPnote Markup for all of the tools listed on the home page is in this repository, as well.  [Curated SOAPnote Markup](https://github.com/soapnote/website-code/tree/master/generator/txt)
