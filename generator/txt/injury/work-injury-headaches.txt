DIAGNOSES:
Headache.  Onset  after industrial injury.  Patient describes a progression in frequency and intensity of headaches.  After reviewing available medical records and performing a history and physical examination of the patient today it is my professional medical opinion that the patient's headaches do have a significant industrial component.  Most probable muscle contraction type headaches, with component of cervical radiculopathy, myelopathy. In my professional opinion imaging of head is necessary to evaluate any other pathologic process such as neoplasm, hematomas, intracerebral bleeding, cerebral edema...
Needs evaluation of renal function, electrolytes, liver enzymes, complete blood count, thyroid function tests.
