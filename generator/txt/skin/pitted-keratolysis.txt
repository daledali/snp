[textarea cols=108 rows=5 default="Pitted keratolysis&#13;&#10;This is a superficial infection of the top layers of the skin associated with various bacteria. The predisposing condition for this is hyperhidrosis of the soles of the feet. &#13;&#10;Aluminium chloride 20% to be applied every night at bedtime helps control the hyperhidrosis as well as erythromycin solution twice daily if possible to the affected areas of the feet. &#13;&#10;Knows to wear shoes that breath, use of Coolmax socks, changing the socks frequently, and gradually extending the times of use for the hyperhidrosis. &#13;&#10;Can consider trial of oral Lamisil with 1 week of oral Keflex."]
