ASSESSMENT:
My impression is that the patient has a Diagnosis of Hammertoe. Treatment is medically necessary to return the patient to normal activities of daily living without limitations.

TREATMENT PLAN:

Pre-Op Diagnosis: Hammertoe, [var name="side"] Foot Post-op Diagnosis: Same
Procedure: Hammertoe Reduction

The patient was brought in and placed in the operating chair, supine position. Approximately [text size=2] cc’s of 2% Lidocaine plain was infiltrated to the base of the digit and metatarsophalangeal joint. Then, the lower leg was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.

Attention was directed to the dorsal aspect of the affected digit, at the level of the proximal interphalangeal joint. Using a #15 blade, a [text size=2] cm dorsolinear incision was made. The incision was deepened with a blunt and sharp dissection, taking great care to preserve all neurovascular structures encountered. The tendon of the extensor digitorium longus and brevis were identified, and using a #15 blade, were freed from the PIPJ. The capsule was freed using a #15 blade, and the bone spur was removed using a bone rongeur. All bone were rasped smooth using a small bone rasp.

The resultant wound was flushed with copious amounts of normal saline solution. The capsular and subcuticular closure was obtained using 3-0 vicryl in simple interrupted fashion. The wound was dressed with xerofoam gauze, dry sterile dressing and conform bandage.

The patient appeared to have tolerated the surgical procedure well, without any complications, and left with all vital signs stable, and in apparent good spirits. Neurovascular status was noted to be intact. A follow-up examination is scheduled for approximately [text size=2] weeks.
