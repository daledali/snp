If you should develop fever greater than 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, abdominal tenderness or pain, or foul smelling vaginal discharge, these are signs of serious infection and you should call your doctor right away. Be aware for excessive breast tenderness, red streaks on the skin of the breast, or warmth or painful swelling of the breast. These are signs of an infection and you should call your doctor. For a short period after pregnancy, you are at increased risk for developing blood clots. If you should notice painful swelling of the leg, one leg warmer than the other, or if you notice shortness of breath at rest, you should contact your doctor. During the first few months after giving birth you are also at risk for postpartum depression. You should have received a handout with information about this condition. If you have not, ask your nurse or doctor. If you should notice any of the signs of depression listed in the handout, contact your doctor. Contact your doctor if you have any other concerns or questions.  You should see your physician in 6 weeks for routine post-partum exam. You will need to schedule a follow up appointment with your primary doctor at six weeks after delivery. Call the appointment desk of your doctor's clinic to make this appointment as soon as possible."]
