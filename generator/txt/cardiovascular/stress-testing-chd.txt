Stress Testing for Diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease[html]
Pretest probability calculator/decision tool[/html]
[select name="gender" value="Female=10|Male=100"] <-- Gender
[select name="age" value="30 to 39=1|40 to 49=2|50 to 59=3|60 to 69=4"] <-- Age
[select name="pain" value="One=10|Two=20|Three=30"] <-- Pain Features (Pain has how many of these features: Substernal location; Provoked by exertion; and/or Relieved by rest/nitroglycerin)
Pretest probability --> [calc memo="pretest probability" value="score=((gender)*(pain))+(age);score>3003?'94%':score>3002?'93%':score>3001?'87%':score>3000?'76%':score>2003?'72%':score>2002?'65%':score>2001?'51%':score>2000?'34%':score>1003?'27%':score>1002?'20%':score>1001?'13%':score>1000?'4%':score>303?'86%':score>302?'73%':score>301?'55%':score>300?'26%':score>203?'51%':score>202?'31%':score>201?'22%':score>200?'12%':score>103?'14%':score>102?'7%':score>101?'3%':'2%'"]
Interpretation and recommendations:
One approach to pretest probability is to consider <20% low, 20-80% intermediate, and >80% high.
Based on your interpretation of pretest probability levels above, consider:
For high pretest probability:  exercise stress test may be performed to aid with prognosis and management.
For intermediate pretest probability:  exercise stress test may be performed to aid with diagnosis.
For low pretest probability:  exercise stress test may have a role in some circumstances, but is not generally recommended.
