1. Thrombocytopenia: [select name="Q1" value="0 points - Platelet Count decreased less than 30 percent from baseline with nadir less than 10,000=0|1 point - Platelet Count decreased 30-50 percent from baseline with nadir 10-20,000=1|2 points - Platelet Count decreased more than 50 percent from baseline with nadir greater than 20,000=2"]
2. Timing after onset of current Heparin course: [select name="Q2" value="0 points - Onset within 4 days and no prior Heparin exposure before this episode=0|1 point - Probable onset days 5-10 (or less than 1 day if prior exposure Heparin 30-100 days ago)=1|2 points - Clear onset days 5-10 (or less than 1 day if prior exposure Heparin within last 30 days)=2"]
3. Thrombosis: [select name="Q3" value="0 points - No thrombosis=0|1 point - Progressive, recurrent or suspected clot=1|2 points - Confirmed new clot, skin necrosis and systemic reaction=2"]
4. Alternative causes of thrombocytopenia: [select name="Q4" value="0 points - Definite alternative cause of Thrombocytopenia=0|1 point - Possible alternative cause of Thrombocytopenia=1|2 points - No other alternative cause of Thrombocytopenia=2"]
