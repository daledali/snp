Chronic Kidney Disease in Diabetes Mellitus - Decision Tool[html]
Summary:  This decision tool assists with management of patients with diabetic nephropathy (diabetes mellitus-related chronic kidney disease, stages III, IV, and V).  It is <strong>not</strong> intended to manage CKD patients on dialysis.
<i>Note:  Detection of kidney disease should prompt a workup to determine the cause.  A recommended initial evaluation includes Complete Metabolic Panel, Urinalysis, Urine Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (UACR), Uric Acid, Phosphate, Complete Blood Count, ANA screen, Rheumatoid Factor, C3, C4, Hepatitis B sAg, Hepatitis C Ab, dilated retinal exam, and renal Ultrasound; if patient is over 40 years & UACR is positive then Serum and Urine Protein Electrophoreses, as well.</i>[/html]
