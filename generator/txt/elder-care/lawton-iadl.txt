Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living[html]
<strong>Summary:</strong> The Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Calculator is useful for identifying current functional level and for detecting trends toward improvement or deterioration. There are eight areas assessed with the Lawton IADL scale.
Women are typically scored on all 8 areas of function and, historically, the areas of food preparation, housekeeping, laundering are excluded for men.
Clients are scored according to their highest level of functioning in that category.
Higher scores indicate independence and high function, while lower scores indicate dependence and low function.
