Mini Cog  [comment memo="The Mini Cog is a very easy, 2 question dementia screening tool.  If you have less time, you could just have them draw the clock."]
Step 1:  Ask the patient to repeat 3 unrelated words such as “ball,” “dog,” and “television.”
Step 2:  Ask the patient to draw a simple clock set to 10 minutes after eleven o’clock (11:10).  A correct response is drawing the a circle with the numbers in approximately the right positions and hands pointing to 11 and 2.
     [select value="No=0|Yes=2" name="step2"] <-- Was the clock drawn correctly? (circle with numbers in place, hands at 11 and 2)?
Step 3:  Ask the patient to recall the three words.
     [select value="Zero=0|One=1|Two=2|Three=3" name="step3"] <-- How many words were recalled correctly?
Score:  [calc value="score=(step2)+(step3)" memo="x"]/5  Interpretation:  [calc value="score=(step2)+(step3); score>2?'Negative screen for dementia':'Positive screen for dementia/further evaluation is warranted'" memo="Interpretation"]
