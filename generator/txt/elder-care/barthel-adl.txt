Total Score --> [calc memo="number" value="score1=(bowels)+(bladder)+(grooming)+(toilet)+(feeding)+(transfer)+(mobility)+(dressing)+(stairs)+(bathing)"] / 20
Interpretation Lower scores indicate increased disability. If used to measure improvement after rehabilitation, changes of more than two points in the total score reflect a probable genuine change, and change on one item from fully dependent to independent is also likely to be reliable.
