Short Form of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (Short IQCODE)

Read to patient: Now we want you to remember what your friend or relative was like 10 years ago and to compare it with what he/she is like now. 10 years ago was the year [text size=4]. Below are situations where this person has to use his/her memory or intelligence and we want you to indicate whether this has improved, stayed the same or got worse in that situation over the past 10 years. Note the importance of comparing his/her present performance with 10 years ago. Possible answers are "Much improved," "A bit improved," "Not much change," "A bit worse," and "Much worse."  So if 10 years ago this person always forgot where he/she had left things, and he/she still does, then this would be considered "Not much change". Please indicate the changes you have observed by choosing the appropriate answer. 
 
Compared with 10 years ago how is this person at:
