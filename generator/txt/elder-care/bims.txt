Brief Interview for Mental Status (BIMS) [html]
This is also part of the Minimum Data Set (MDS) used in the care of nursing home residents.[/html][checkbox memo="show instructions" name="Q0" value=" "][conditional field="Q0" condition="(Q0).is(' ')"][html]
Instructions: 
The interview should be attempted if the individual is at least sometimes understood
verbally or in writing, and if an interpreter is needed and one is available.
The interview should not be attempted if the individual is rarely/never understood or
an interpreter is needed but not available.
BASIC INTERVIEW INSTRUCTIONS FOR BIMS:
1. Interview any individual not excluded as indicated above.
2. Conduct the interview in a private setting if at all possible.
3. Be sure the individual can hear you. An individual with a hearing impairment should be tested using their usual communication devices/techniques as applicable.
4. Sit so that the individual can see your face.
5. Give an introduction.
Suggested language: “I would like to ask you some questions. We ask everyone these same questions. This will help us to provide you with better recommendations. Some of the questions may seem very easy, while others may be more difficult.”
6. If the individual expresses concern that you are testing his or her memory, he or she may be more comfortable if you reply: “We ask these questions of everyone so we can make sure that we can meet your needs.”

1. Repetition of Three Words
Ask the individual: “I am going to say three words for you to remember. Please repeat the words after I
have said all three. The words are: sock, blue and bed. Now tell me the three words.”
[select name="Q1" value="None (score 0)=0|One (score 1)=1|Two (score 2)=2|Three (score 3)=3"] <-- Number of words repeated after first attempt
After the individual’s first attempt, repeat the words using cues (“sock, something to wear; blue a color; bed, a piece of furniture”). You may repeat the words up to two more times.

2. Temporal Orientation (orientation to year, month, and day)
Ask the individual: “Please tell me what year it is right now.”
[select name="Q2" value="Missed by more than 5 years or no answer (score 0)=0|Missed by 2-5 years (score 1)=1|Missed by 1 year (score 2)=2|Correct (score 3)=3"] <-- Able to report correct year

Ask the individual: “What month are we in right now?”
[select name="Q3" value="Missed by more than 1 month or no answer (score 0)=0|Missed by 6 days to 1 month (score 1)=1|Accurate within 5 days (score 2)=2"] <-- Able to report correct month

Ask the individual: “What day of the week is today?
[select name="Q4" value="Incorrect or no answer (score 0)=0|Correct (score 1)=1"] <-- Able to report correct day of the week

3. Recall
Ask individual: “Let’s go back to an earlier question: What were those three words that I asked you to repeat?” If unable to remember a word, give cue (something to wear; a color; a piece of furniture) for that word.
[select name="Q5" value="No, could not recall (score 0)=0|Yes, after cueing with SOMETHING TO WEAR (score 1)=1|Yes, no cue required (score 2)=2"] <-- Able to recall SOCK

[select name="Q6" value="No, could not recall (score 0)=0|Yes, after cueing with A COLOR (score 1)=1|Yes, no cue required (score 2)=2"] <-- Able to recall BLUE

[select name="Q7" value="No, could not recall (score 0)=0|Yes, after cueing with A PIECE OF FURNITURE (score 1)=1|Yes, no cue required (score 2)=2"] <-- Able to recall BED

TOTAL SCORE --> [calc value="score=(Q1)+(Q2)+(Q3)+(Q4)+(Q5)+(Q6)+(Q7)" memo="number"] / 15
INTERPRETATION --> [calc value="score2=(Q1)+(Q2)+(Q3)+(Q4)+(Q5)+(Q6)+(Q7);score2>12?'Cognitively intact':score2>7?'Moderately impaired':'Severe impairment'" memo="result"]
