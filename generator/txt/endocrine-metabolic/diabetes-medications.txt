Diabetes medication decision tool[html]
This decision tool is intended to help select medications for diabetes on the basis of liver and renal function/impairment.[/html]
Step 1: Select serum creatinine level
[select name="Q1" value="less than 1.4 mg/dL for women OR less than 1.5 mg/dL for men=1|1.4-2.0 mg/dL for women OR 1.5-2.0 mg/dL for men=2|greater than 2.0 mg/dL=3"]

Step 2: Select ALT or Child-Pugh score [html]<a href="http://www.soapnote.org/digestive-system/child-pugh-score/" target="_blank">http://www.soapnote.org/digestive-system/child-pugh-score/</a>[/html]
[select name="Q2" value="ALT less than 2.5 times ULN or Child Pugh 5-6=10|ALT greater than or equal to 2.5 times ULN or Child Pugh 7-9=100|Child-Pugh greater than 9=1000"]

RESULT --> [calc memo="recommendation" value="score=(Q1)*(Q2);score>999?'severe liver impairment and any level of renal function.  insulin only. ':score>299?'moderate liver impairment and serum creatinine more than 2. DPP-4 inhibitor at renal dose, meglinitide with caution, consider insulin. ':score>199?'moderate liver and renal impairment.
