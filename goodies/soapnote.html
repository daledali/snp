There is a lot you can do here.  There's a huge amount of stuff here.  Do something good with it.  Help a patient with it.  That's why it's here.  That's why it has to be free and shared.
</br>
</br>
First of all, all of the code for this site is open source.  That means that the site will get better with the help of a few computer programmers that want to help improve the quality of medical care.  You can read more about open-source software at <a href="http://opensource.org" target="_blank">Open Source Initiative</a>.  The site utilizes a GNU General Public License.  The actual license is <a href="https://github.com/soapnote/SOAPnote-site/blob/master/LICENSE.txt" target="_blank">here</a>.
</br>
</br>
You can find all of the code for the site at the <a href="https://github.com/soapnote/SOAPnote-site" target="_blank">SOAPnote-site Github page</a>.
</br>
</br>
If you're not interested in coding a website, but you are interested in the SOAPnote templates, there's more good news.  All of the templates in the form of <a href="/lingo/" target="_blank">SOAPnote Markup</a> are also on Github.  You can find all of the templates categorized by system at <a href="https://github.com/soapnote/SOAPnote-site/tree/master/generator/txt" target="_blank">this Github page</a>.  Hopefully, you'll find something you can use that fits your needs.
</br>
</br>
Finally, there's an app that is being developed.  If you don't have good cellular or wifi where you work (like me) this might come in handy.  It works, but it's a little rough still.  It's not on an app store yet, but it's at <a href="https://build.phonegap.com/apps/1521671/builds" target="_blank">this page</a> and you can download it and try it.  (It's open source, too.)
