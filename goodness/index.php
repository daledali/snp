<h2>Free iOS and Android App</h2>
There's a SOAPnote app that includes curated content from the website.  If you don't have good cellular or wifi where you work (like me) this might come in handy.  It's at <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.soapnote.app" target="_blank">Google Play</a> for Android.  It is at <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/soapnote.org-app/id1046761652?mt=8" target="_blank">iTunes</a> for Apple devices.

</br>
Please go to the <a href="http://www.soapnote.org/help/">help page</a> if you have a question, an idea, or if you would like to report a problem.
</br>
</br>
And if you like this site and/or the app feel free to donate <a href="http://paypal.me/soapnote/2">a cup of coffee</a> to keep me working on it.
