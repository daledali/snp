There is a lot you can do here.  There's a huge amount of stuff here.  Do something good with it.  Help a patient with it.  That's why it's here.  That's why it has to be free and shared.
</br>
</br>
First of all, all of the code for this site is open source.  That means that the site will get better with the help of a few computer programmers that want to help improve the quality of medical care.  You can read more about open-source software at <a href="http://opensource.org" target="_blank">Open Source Initiative</a>.  The site utilizes a GNU General Public License.  The actual license is <a href="https://github.com/soapnote/SOAPnote-site/blob/master/LICENSE.txt" target="_blank">here</a>.
</br>
</br>
You can find all of the code for the site at the <a href="https://github.com/soapnote/SOAPnote-site" target="_blank">SOAPnote-site Github page</a>.
</br>
</br>
If you're not interested in coding a website, but you are interested in the SOAPnote templates, there's more good news.  All of the templates in the form of <a href="/lingo/" target="_blank">SOAPnote Markup</a> are also on Github.  You can find all of the templates categorized by system at <a href="https://github.com/soapnote/SOAPnote-site/tree/master/generator/txt/generator/txt" target="_blank">this Github page</a>.  Hopefully, you'll find something you can use that fits your needs.
</br>
</br>
Finally, there's a SOAPnote app that includes curated content from the website.  If you don't have good cellular or wifi where you work (like me) this might come in handy.  It's at <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.soapnote.app" target="_blank">Google Play</a> for Android.  It is at <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/soapnote.org-app/id1046761652?mt=8" target="_blank">iTunes</a> for Apple devices.  For Blackberry users, the app is at <a href="https://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/59981113/?lang=en&countrycode=US" target="_blank">Blackberry World</a>.  For EVERYONE, this App is FREE to use and has ZERO ads.  By the way, it's open source, too - the code for it is also at <a href="https://github.com/soapnote/SOAPnote-app" target="_blank">Github</a>
